---------
The GeneBankCreateBTree class creates a binary file that stores BTree data. This data is read by the GeneBankSearch class.
---------
Structure of BTree in binary file:

The binary file starts with three integer values containing metadata for the BTree.
BTree metadata:
    ~ Degree (Integer: 4 bytes)
    ~ Number of nodes (Integer: 4 bytes)
    ~ Size of key in bytes (Integer: 4 bytes)
After the BTree meta data, there is a sequence of n nodes, where n is the number of nodes in the BTree.
Each node contains:
    ~ 2t+1 possible pointers, where t is the degree (Each pointer = 1 Integer. 4*(2t-1) total bytes)
    ~ 2t-1 possible keys (keySize*(2t-1) bytes)
    ~ Number of keys stored (Integer: 4 bytes)
    ~ Number of children (Integer: 4 bytes)
    ~ This nodes location (Integer: 4 bytes)
Further notes:
    ~ A pointer stores a node's offset from the end of the BTree metadata.
    ~ Because each key we store is a long (8 bytes), 
     and we also have to store the frequency of the key in an integer (4 bytes),
     the amount of data stored in one key (keySize) is a total of 12 bytes.
    ~ The total size of a node is (12 + 4*(2*t+1) + keySize*(2*t-1)).
    ~ The root node can be determined as it is the only node with a null parent pointer.
